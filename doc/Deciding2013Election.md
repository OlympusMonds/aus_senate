To decide the 2013 election using our algorithm we need:

1. GVT usage file indicating how many people voted above the line for different tickets.
  This maps trivially to our ballot representation, given a list of candidates for each GVT.
2. Below the line voting information. This is available for individual electorates, in a big zip
   (43MB of data for NSW).
